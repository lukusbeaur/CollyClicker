1. Fix the way links.csv is written to in app.go
Get links from table, or CSV files already saved 
If getting links from table, Use the handler for link retrieval and then go to pinger ( check notes about fobidden below )
Use pinger to check all the links for 200 status if works add them to working csv files
rewrite to use passing working file inside the scraper handler functions 

Why the fuck am i getting forbidden on this initial table pull to get the season links?


2. 6/10 - When I have multiple sources of links, say different seasons with same tables, figure out how to 
manage files of CSVs. Ex it pulls table links from 2025 season, saves it in links.csv. Then a pinger checks all links and adds 
it to pass or fail csv. 
-How do we manage old links we want to save, or new links on different season. Maybe we some how add the date of the season 
to the links? 
- how do we manage the missing data from the failed links
