1. Fix the way links.csv is written to in app.go
Get links from table, or CSV files already saved 
If getting links from table, Use the handler for link retrieval and then go to pinger ( check notes about fobidden below )
Use pinger to check all the links for 200 status if works add them to working csv files
rewrite to use passing working file inside the scraper handler functions 

Why the fuck am i getting forbidden on this initial table pull to get the season links?
